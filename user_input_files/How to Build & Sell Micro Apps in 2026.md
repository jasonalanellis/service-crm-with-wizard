Here's what entrepreneurs get wrong the  
0:02  
most. They assume that just because  
0:04  
these huge companies right here exist  
0:06  
that there's no opportunity for them to  
0:09  
create individualized software for the  
0:12  
tens of thousands of industries that  
0:14  
exist. Specifically, software to manage  
0:17  
your customers, CRM, customer  
0:19  
relationship management software. Today,  
0:21  
I'm going to use AI to build a niche CRM  
0:24  
software with AI because I don't know  
0:27  
how to code. And I'm going to stress  
0:28  
test three different AI tools against  
0:30  
each other to see which one is best. And  
0:32  
then I'm going to show you how to find  
0:34  
paying customers so you can get that  
0:36  
sweet, sweet recurring subscription  
0:38  
revenue. So, let's dive in.  
0:43  
But first, how to know which industry to  
0:46  
build software for? Well, I'm going to  
0:48  
use Claude to answer that question for  
0:49  
me. Here's my prompt. I want to build a  
0:52  
CRM for a very niche local or home  
0:55  
service business industry. What are 10  
0:57  
niches in this category that are growing  
0:59  
like crazy backed by hard data? And I'm  
1:02  
going to use their 4.5 model because it  
1:04  
is incredible. Now, why am I asking  
1:06  
this? Why not just build a CRM for  
1:07  
pressure washers or landscapers? Because  
1:09  
I want to ride a tidal wave. I want my  
1:11  
life to be easier and you do too, which  
1:13  
is why you're watching this video. So,  
1:15  
if I launch this CRM in a shrinking home  
1:17  
service category, like epoxy flooring, I  
1:20  
can still be successful. It's just going  
1:21  
to be harder. Now, it looks like it's  
1:23  
doing research on the pool service  
1:24  
industry, which would make sense to me  
1:26  
because everyone and their brother got a  
1:27  
pool during and right after COVID. So,  
1:29  
now those pools need to be serviced.  
1:31  
Okay, the top four industries. EV  
1:33  
charger installation. I don't really  
1:35  
like that one because I think it's going  
1:36  
to be highly concentrated. There's going  
1:38  
to be a handful of businesses that do  
1:40  
the bulk of this work. And I want an  
1:42  
industry that's highly fragmented with a  
1:44  
lot of solo operators. Number two is  
1:46  
pool service and maintenance. Really  
1:48  
like that. It's growing at 12% a year.  
1:50  
Three, solar panel cleaning. Also love  
1:52  
that industry. And number four, water  
1:54  
damage restoration. My gut tells me pool  
1:56  
service. I don't know why. I'm going to  
1:58  
go with that. Okay. Now that we have an  
1:59  
industry, I'm going to prompt Claude  
2:01  
again in a new window and say this.  
2:03  
Here's my prompt. I want to build a dead  
2:05  
simple but super niche CRM for  
2:08  
independent pool service business  
2:09  
operators. Now remember CRM customer  
2:12  
relationship management. It shouldn't  
2:13  
have too many fields for customer data,  
2:15  
but it should have enough and it should  
2:17  
be clear to an operator in this industry  
2:19  
that this software is for their industry  
2:21  
and not something generic like HubSpot.  
2:24  
Sorry, HubSpot, but they are so freaking  
2:25  
expensive and way too complex for 98% of  
2:28  
business owners. And then I added, I  
2:30  
have no coding experience. Please code  
2:32  
this web app and show me the UI ASAP  
2:35  
user interface what it looks like and  
2:37  
go. All right. Now, let's copy and paste  
2:40  
this prompt across both Replet and  
2:42  
ChatgPT and see how they compare. Okay.  
2:45  
Same prompt at ChatGpt, same prompt at  
2:48  
Replet. All right. Let's go ahead and  
2:50  
start a timer and see which one of them  
2:51  
is fastest because we're judging the  
2:53  
quality and the speed here. All right,  
2:55  
Claude did not disappoint. That took  
2:57  
about 117 seconds, which is less than 2  
3:00  
minutes. It made Pool Pro CRM built for  
3:03  
pool service professionals. I've got  
3:05  
kind of like a fake dashboard showing  
3:07  
how many active pools, aka customers I  
3:09  
have, weekly revenue, monthly projected,  
3:11  
and today's stops. I can search by name  
3:14  
or address. I like that it filled in  
3:16  
some dummy data for me. I search for  
3:17  
John, and I get Johnson family. You've  
3:20  
got tags here. Monday, weekly. So, it  
3:23  
looks like this first tag shows me what  
3:25  
day I'm supposed to service them. That's  
3:27  
cool. Didn't tell it to do that. The  
3:29  
second tag shows me how often I service  
3:31  
them. Weekly, bi-weekly, three times  
3:34  
weekly. And the third tag shows me how  
3:36  
much I charge per visit. And then over  
3:38  
here on the right, you've got different  
3:39  
colors. Red, yellow, green, active,  
3:42  
paused, and I assume red would be  
3:44  
churned or canceled. I can filter up  
3:46  
here just by clicking the day of the  
3:48  
week. So basically every day I can wake  
3:50  
up, open my app or my web app, click on  
3:53  
the day of the week I'm on, or it I can  
3:55  
just code it to show me the day of the  
3:57  
week that it's on because of course the  
3:58  
app can know what day it is. And I can  
4:00  
just see what's my to-do list today. And  
4:02  
then up here on the top right, I click  
4:04  
add pool. Let's do kerner family at 1  
4:07  
123 maple. Looks like none of these  
4:09  
fields are required, which I appreciate.  
4:12  
Oo, it has different types of pools. Six  
4:14  
different types. gunnite fiberglass  
4:16  
vinyl above ground commercial spa/hot  
4:18  
tub because maybe I'm only servicing a  
4:20  
hot tub pool size in gallons service day  
4:22  
frequency. So, I love that Claude Code  
4:24  
just knew what I would need to put in  
4:27  
here, right? I didn't have to say, "All  
4:28  
right, make a field for pool size, for  
4:31  
pool type, service day, frequency. Yeah,  
4:33  
it just knew gate code even. That's  
4:35  
awesome. Rate per visit. Cool. Let's do  
4:38  
$94  
4:40  
per visit. Let's do on call. See what  
4:43  
that happens there. We service them on  
4:46  
Thursdays. It's an above ground pool  
4:48  
because I did go to school in Alabama.  
4:50  
So, that works. equipment. We'll put  
4:52  
heater service notes. Mean dog. So,  
4:55  
let's see if my revenue automatically  
4:57  
updates. It's $94 per visit and add pool  
5:00  
to roster. Cool. Went from four to five  
5:02  
active pools. Monthly projected. That  
5:04  
didn't change because I set it for on  
5:06  
call, not recurring. If I go in here,  
5:09  
click on the kerner family log service.  
5:12  
Now, one thing that it doesn't have yet  
5:14  
is these records are not editable once I  
5:18  
add them. So, I'm just going to ask  
5:19  
Claude to fix that. Make these records  
5:21  
editable after I add a new customer.  
5:24  
Let's hit the timer. All right, Claude  
5:26  
finished super fast. Let's check on  
5:28  
Replet. Okay, Replet, what have you been  
5:30  
doing? It made a plan for me. Now, I'm  
5:33  
not a big fan of planning. I just want  
5:35  
to do stuff. So, here's a seven bullet  
5:38  
point. Yeah, build the entire app. It's  
5:41  
quoting 20 minutes. Cloud was done in  
5:43  
under two, but maybe this is going to be  
5:45  
a better app. Start building. And we'll  
5:47  
check on chat GPT. What do we got?  
5:49  
Thought for 49 seconds. Here's a first  
5:52  
pass. Okay, it gave me the code for the  
5:54  
app, but I don't know what any of that  
5:56  
means. I'm going to say, show me what it  
5:59  
looks like like cla code does. You  
6:01  
always want to make the apps jealous of  
6:02  
each other or competitive with each  
6:04  
other. I promise you it works. Okay, it  
6:06  
looks like Jet GPT is working on my  
6:08  
request. Replet is still building. Okay,  
6:11  
that took about another 2 minutes and  
6:13  
now this should be editable. Let's see  
6:16  
if it actually works. So, how to edit.  
6:18  
Click on any pool. Click the edit button  
6:20  
in the detailed panel header. So, I'm  
6:22  
going to click on one. There it is right  
6:24  
there. Edit. Awesome. And I'm going to  
6:26  
say instead of rate per visit, I'm going  
6:28  
to add a zero and say 1,500. And then  
6:30  
let's see if my monthly projected  
6:32  
changes. It should change by a lot cuz  
6:34  
right now it's $3,300 total per month  
6:36  
across all customers. So, save changes.  
6:38  
Boom. $9,100 a month is my MR after  
6:42  
editing that field. So, very cool. I  
6:45  
love how you can filter by day or just  
6:47  
look at all the days at once. Like this.  
6:49  
I don't know what I would like I  
6:51  
admittedly don't know enough about the  
6:52  
pool service industry to really know  
6:54  
what I don't know, right? But this seems  
6:56  
awesome. Now I just need to add a stripe  
6:58  
integration which Claude Code can do. I  
7:00  
did it with another app and I just need  
7:02  
to start selling this thing. Okay,  
7:03  
checking in on Replet. It's been 4 and  
7:05  
1/2 minutes still building. Checking in  
7:08  
on chat GPT. We can click preview here.  
7:11  
Okay, there it is. There it is. All  
7:13  
right. I like the gradient, the color  
7:15  
from, you know, blue to green. That's  
7:17  
cool. The tagging mechanism looks  
7:19  
similar. You got a drop down from like  
7:21  
2008\. I don't know. This looks ugly. It  
7:24  
didn't show me the preview right off the  
7:25  
bat. I had to ask for it. And I had to  
7:27  
scroll up here to see, well, maybe I'm  
7:29  
just an idiot. There'd be a preview  
7:30  
button the first time and I just didn't  
7:31  
see it. But nope, I scrolled all the way  
7:33  
to top. It's not there. So, like clearly  
7:35  
chat GPT is not catering to the  
7:38  
non-technical founder, the non-coder  
7:40  
like myself, right? I don't know what to  
7:42  
do with this. I don't know what this  
7:43  
code means. I just want to see the  
7:44  
preview. So, including the second  
7:47  
prompt, chat GPT was pretty fast. It  
7:49  
took about 4 minutes in total, whereas  
7:51  
Replet's at 4 minutes and it's still  
7:53  
going. But Claud was almost perfect  
7:55  
within 2 minutes. And the user interface  
7:57  
of Claude code was much better, whereas  
7:59  
JGBT, it's just kind of ugly. Checking  
8:01  
in on Replet. It's now been 6 1/2  
8:03  
minutes. It said 20 in its defense. So,  
8:05  
what I'm going to need to see from  
8:06  
Replet is something a lot better than  
8:08  
what Claude code spit out. While I wait  
8:10  
for this, I'm going to ask Google how  
8:11  
many pool service operators are in the  
8:13  
US. 79,000 pool service businesses. It  
8:17  
is a growing and highly fragmented  
8:18  
market with no dominant player. Now,  
8:20  
could you charge 100 bucks a month for  
8:21  
this software? Yeah, but let's be extra  
8:23  
conservative and say 20 bucks a month.  
8:25  
Now, can I find a way to get 1,000 of  
8:27  
these 79,000 businesses to pay me 20  
8:30  
bucks a month? If so, then I have like  
8:33  
1.5% of the market and I'm making  
8:36  
$20,000 a month. Not freaking bad. Hey,  
8:38  
let's make it $100 software and it's  
8:40  
$100,000 a month. Our conversion rate  
8:42  
goes down because it's more expensive,  
8:43  
but our profit goes way, way up. Easy?  
8:46  
No. Simple? Yes. Is there a path to find  
8:48  
those customers? Absolutely. I'm about  
8:50  
to show you. All right. So, Replet has  
8:51  
been going for 16 minutes. Didn't quite  
8:54  
get to 20, but eight times longer than  
8:56  
Cloud Code and about four times longer  
8:58  
than ChatGpt. And this is what it came  
8:59  
up with. Not bad. It looks very similar  
9:02  
to Claude Code, but it took a lot longer  
9:03  
to get there. New service visit. I don't  
9:05  
like that it doesn't have the tagging. I  
9:07  
guess it's got some tagging here, but a  
9:09  
different type of tagging. Like I have  
9:10  
to think that the type of vacuuming or  
9:13  
the type of service that you're doing is  
9:14  
not as important or as relevant to show  
9:17  
before clicking into the lead. This just  
9:19  
looks a little more outdated with your  
9:20  
sidebar along the left, black and white,  
9:23  
but it definitely solidly comes in  
9:25  
second place when it comes to the user  
9:26  
interface. And it's still building. You  
9:28  
can see here on the left, it's done  
9:30  
enough to show me what it looks like,  
9:32  
but it's not done done. So all in all,  
9:34  
how I would rank them is Chad GBT third  
9:36  
dead last. I think Chad GBT is like a  
9:38  
consumer app first. It's not meant for  
9:40  
coding. It's meant for being like a  
9:42  
thought partner, which is great for  
9:44  
that. I use it for that all the time.  
9:45  
Replet is in second place cuz at the end  
9:47  
of the day, if the product works, it  
9:49  
doesn't really matter if it takes 2  
9:50  
minutes or 16\. But I didn't like how it  
9:52  
looked either. So it took a lot longer  
9:54  
and it didn't look as good. It didn't  
9:55  
seem to be as functional. And number one  
9:57  
clearly was Claw Code. It took under 2  
10:00  
minutes. It looked great. I needed one  
10:02  
follow-up prompt to make the fields  
10:03  
editable, but that's a win for me. All  
10:05  
right, now the magic question. How can  
10:07  
we actually find paying customers,  
10:08  
especially if we don't know how to build  
10:10  
Facebook or Google ads? We just know how  
10:12  
to Google stuff. Well, all right. We're  
10:14  
going to go over to Facebook, the old  
10:15  
standby. We're going to go to groups.  
10:17  
We're going to type in pool service. And  
10:18  
I know, don't just think like, oh,  
10:20  
you're showing us Facebook groups. I  
10:22  
already know about that. No, no. I'm  
10:23  
going to walk you through how I look at  
10:24  
it and what my strategy would be. All I  
10:26  
did was type in pool service. I'm going  
10:27  
to filter by groups near me. It helps  
10:30  
because if you're able to honestly say  
10:32  
like, "Hey, I'm here in the area." Then  
10:33  
you'll have more credibility and  
10:34  
legitimacy, but there won't be as many  
10:36  
groups to pick from. So, I'm usually  
10:38  
going to look for the private groups  
10:41  
because those are usually more  
10:42  
moderated. They have less spam. Swimming  
10:45  
pool repair and services, 17,000  
10:47  
members. And don't be like immediately  
10:49  
turned on by big numbers because there's  
10:51  
often a correlation between a big  
10:53  
Facebook group and a lowquality Facebook  
10:56  
group. oftentimes smaller is better  
10:58  
because it's easier for the managers to  
11:00  
wrap their arms around it. We're going  
11:01  
to look at Texas pool pros because I'm  
11:03  
in Texas. Then let's look at some public  
11:05  
groups just so we can see if they are  
11:07  
high quality. Okay, so we're going to  
11:09  
look around. This guy posted an hour  
11:11  
ago. He already has two comments. This  
11:13  
guy posted yesterday, they have eight  
11:15  
comments. This looks pretty solid even  
11:18  
though it's a public group. I think the  
11:19  
downside to this group is it's mostly  
11:21  
homeowners and not operators. Texas Pool  
11:24  
Pros. Looks like a company called Elite  
11:26  
Chlorine is the admin, which makes  
11:28  
sense. You must be a pool service  
11:30  
industry professional. Awesome. So, what  
11:32  
I would do is I would join one of these  
11:34  
and I would just start asking around for  
11:35  
feedback. Hey, I built this uh software.  
11:38  
If you guys had the perfect CRM for your  
11:40  
business, like what would it have? What  
11:41  
would it do? And you're just like you  
11:43  
you're getting real feedback. You're  
11:44  
actually implementing the feedback. And  
11:45  
then when it comes time for you to  
11:46  
launch, which hopefully is very soon,  
11:48  
you can go back to all the people that  
11:50  
commented or liked or helped you out and  
11:52  
DM them and say, "Hey, thank you for  
11:53  
helping me. Would you like to use this  
11:54  
for free? I just want good feedback. I  
11:56  
want referrals. I want case studies. I  
11:58  
want reviews." And that's your ticket  
12:00  
right there. Then after a while, A, see  
12:01  
if they'll pay for it. B, see if you can  
12:03  
get a review. C, see if you can get a  
12:05  
referral because they probably know  
12:07  
other pool service business owners as  
12:09  
well. Okay, this group over here, 12,000  
12:11  
people, very spammy, no engagement on  
12:13  
any of these posts. So, I would skip  
12:15  
that. This group over here, no new posts  
12:18  
today, 14 in the last month. So, it  
12:19  
might be well moderated, but it's not  
12:21  
very active. If it's not active, it  
12:23  
means your post is going to stand out  
12:25  
like a sore thumb. Often in a bad way.  
12:27  
To me, it looks like Texas Pool Pros is  
12:29  
the winner. It is private, so I can't  
12:31  
see it just yet, but they have three new  
12:33  
posts a day. It's created six years ago.  
12:35  
It looks to be pretty well moderated.  
12:37  
Another thing you can do is go to Gummy  
12:39  
Search and Gummy Search will pull data  
12:42  
from Reddit to tell you what features a  
12:44  
piece of software should have or what  
12:45  
features pool service business owners  
12:47  
are craving. Gummy search is basically  
12:49  
like an AI for Reddit. It aggregates and  
12:52  
organizes all of their data so you can  
12:54  
find the pain points. Reddit can be a  
12:55  
gold mine, I'm telling you. Another  
12:57  
thing I would do is I would use Claude's  
12:59  
deep research. You just go here, you  
13:02  
click the filter button, then you click  
13:03  
the research toggle and prompt it  
13:06  
something like, hey, I need to know what  
13:08  
pain points that pool service businesses  
13:10  
have with their software. What do they  
13:12  
hate? What do they love? What are they  
13:13  
can't live withouts? What are the big  
13:14  
players in the industry? And you can use  
13:16  
that data to build a better product. And  
13:19  
you can also use that data to address  
13:21  
those pain points in your ads to make  
13:23  
your cost of acquiring a new customer  
13:25  
much less because the more effective  
13:27  
your ads, the easier it will be to  
13:29  
acquire customers with them. You don't  
13:30  
know how to do Facebook ads? I made a  
13:32  
video all about that. Facebook ads for  
13:34  
beginners. Look what happens when I go  
13:36  
to Google Trends and type in pool  
13:38  
service software. Look what's happened.  
13:40  
That's crazy. Just this year in 2025,  
13:43  
we're at the end of 2025 here. It  
13:45  
started spiking. It's going up like  
13:46  
crazy. So, this industry clearly is  
13:48  
booming. Another way to find customers  
13:50  
here is to cold email them. Use  
13:52  
something like outscraper to scrape  
13:54  
every single pool service business in  
13:56  
your area. You don't need any coding  
13:57  
experience. You just need a few clicks.  
13:59  
You can text them. You can call them.  
14:01  
You can email them and say, "Hey, I  
14:03  
built a free software just for pool  
14:04  
service operators. Do you want to use it  
14:06  
90 days free or 100% free and then get  
14:08  
them to pay later or 100% free until you  
14:11  
get your first five customers. All of  
14:12  
your customers are on the internet.  
14:14  
Scrape them and do outreach to them.  
14:16  
Scrape all 79,000, upload them to your  
14:19  
Facebook ad campaign as a custom  
14:21  
audience, and then Facebook will show  
14:23  
ads, your ad for your software only to  
14:26  
those pool service owners. It's magical.  
14:28  
I hope this helped. Please check out
